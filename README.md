This is a chrome extension which helps you to search in the stackoverflow from anywhere on the browser. Just open the extension and start typing.

## Why would you use it
- From anywhere anytime in the browser you can search for queries in stackoverflow and get quick results.
- Easy to use
- No further dependencies means it's just download and run.
- Works on any platform(Windows, Mac, Linux) given that you have a browser that supports Chrome extensions(preferably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)).
## Instructions for installing

- Download the zip and extract the folder or clone the **StackSource** folder.
   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/alpha-zeta/StackSource.git
  ```
- Open Chrome, go to settings->Extensions or just got to this link [[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)]. 
- turn on **Developer mode**, found on the top right corner of the page.

Now you should be able to see the StackSource extension available in the extensions menu and also in the extension shortcut beside the searchbar

## How to use

- First you have to open the extension, which can be done in two ways
  - Click on the extension icon from the extension menu.
  - Can also be easily opened by pressing the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Y` key (works in both Windows and Linux).
- Now put your query in the searchbar.
- The search result can be accessed in two ways
   - 1 second after you stop typing it will show the search results in the results section underneath the searchbar.
     - If you click on any of the fetched question it will open that question in a new tab without loosing focus on the current tab, thus you can open multiple questions simultaneouly.
  - If you press enter or click the search button it will lead you to a new tab with the official stackoverflow search results page for your query. 
- Follow the Demo for further clarification.
